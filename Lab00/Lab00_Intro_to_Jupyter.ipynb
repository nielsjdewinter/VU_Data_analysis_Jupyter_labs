You will just be asked to perform some simple tasks in Jupyter related to the material you learned in the Statistics part of the course. You will not be asked to produce your own code in this exercise, but make sure you read the code in the code blocks and the comments written next to it so you can follow what is happening. This will be important practice that will make the labs later in the course much easier!"

The petal length for the \"setosa\" species looks pretty significantly different, but between \"versicolor\" and \"virginica\" it is a bit harder to tell. Let's do a z-test to test if they are different. We first need to import the function `ztest` from the `statsmodels` package. If you want, you can look up the `help()` page of this function to see what it does (or look [here](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.weightstats.ztest.html)).

    "That concludes our short Intro-lab into Python and Jupyter. If you came this far, you probably have Jupyter and Python running smoothly on your PC or laptop and are ready for the exercises in the Data Analysis course. I hope you have seen that Python can be a very powerful tool for doing statistics. Many tests and operations can be performed much faster in Python (or other programming languages) than by hand or in Excel. However, we need to be very careful with the way we write our code, because mistakes in your code blocks can be hard to detect. Make sure you always add comments to your code to track what you are doing and check whether the outcomes of your calculations make sense by printing the variables you produce and manipulate. Good luck with the exercises!"
