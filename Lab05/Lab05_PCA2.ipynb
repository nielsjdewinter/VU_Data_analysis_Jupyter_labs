Algae are more abundant in summer, when temperatures are warmer. Algae need nitrogen and phosphate for their growth. So, when there are lots of algae the concentrations of N and P are reduced. The main source of N and P in river water is polluted water from households and industries. Because of that, N and P concentrations may be influenced by changes in environmental laws and restrictions. These have more influence on N concentrations, than P concentrations because the latter are difficult to remove from polluted water. Water temperature and drainage are strongly seasonally dependent. In summer, temperature is high and drainage low, while the opposite occurs in winter."
