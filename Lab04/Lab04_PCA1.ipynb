In fact, a PCA always initially yields a number of components equal to the number of variables in the dataset. However, the amount of variance in the dataset that is explained by a component decreases down the list. To keep track of how much variance each component explains (and therefore how important it is), we can calculate the *eigenvalues* of the components. We do this by dividing the variance explained by each component by the total amount of variance in the dataset, and we multiply by 100% to make the numbers easier to interpret:"
