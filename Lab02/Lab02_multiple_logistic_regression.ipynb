Make sure you have completed Lab 01 first before starting on this one, because we will assume all the concepts in the first lab are familiar to you now. As a consequence, in this lab, there will be less \"hand holding\" and you will need to figure out more Python coding yourself. We will also assume from now on that the Jupyter format is familiar to you, although you are also still free to run the code in your own Spyder environment. If you ever get lost trying to get something done in Python, you can always go back to Lab 01 to check for examples about how to code things."
